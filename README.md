# ECE-588-Final-Project: Hand Detection for ASL Recognition

This is the source code repository for Aaron Romain's and Michael Kirkhart's final project for the University of Michigan - Dearborn ECE-588 Robot Vision course for the Summer 2017 semester.  The repository is split into two repositories: final-project and test-projects.

## final-project

This repository contains the actual project source code.

## test-projects

This repository contains the source code for several programs used to test out individual pieces of functionality used as part of the final project.

## Development environment

For both the final project and the test project, the following development environment was used:

* Xubuntu 16.04 32 bit and Xubuntu 16.04 64 bit
* OpenCV version 3.2.0 built from source with the opencv_contrib-3.2.0 modules (this is so we could make use of both SIFT and SURF, if needed)
* OpenKinect library version 0.5.3 installed from the Ubuntu package repositories (libfreenect-dev)
